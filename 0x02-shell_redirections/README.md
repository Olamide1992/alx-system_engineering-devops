>>How to redirect standard output to a file
>>How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
>>How to send the output from one program to the input of another program
>>How to combine commands and filters with redirections
Also I master the use of special characters like

>>Understand what do the white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde and how and when to use them

I also Master other Man Pages like:
How to display a line of text
How to concatenate files and print on the standard output
How to reverse a string
How to remove sections from each line of files
What is the /etc/passwd file and what is its format

All of these are implemented in the projects added to this directory. Happy coding!
